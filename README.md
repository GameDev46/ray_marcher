# ray_marcher

An early attempt at the raymarching algorithm in vanilla Javascript, I have created a faster and better version using webgl and glsl [in this github repository](https://github.com/GameDev46/fractal_raytracer)

## Wesite

You can try out the program on its [website](https://gamedev46.github.io/ray_marcher/) or download the files and run it locally on your computer though this is a development build of the project and so is not the most user friendly!
